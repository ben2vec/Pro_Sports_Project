This project was an examination of the affects Professional Sports teams have on their cities economy. 
Our goal was to see if we could discover a relationship between sports teams and the state of the economy of a city.

There is plenty of sports data available for use, but we only had 20 years of economic data. On top of this, we were not able to examine the tax cuts cities provide to sports teams.

Several catagorical variables we provided were if a team relocated to a city that year, a new stadium, making the playoffs, changing ownership, population, and more.

Our findings were that the largest cities already had many sports teams and that the only addition professional sports teams had to their cities would be potential happiness.
